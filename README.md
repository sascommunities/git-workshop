# Using Git with your SAS projects

This project contains supporting materials for the Git &amp; SAS hands-on workshop presented at [SESUG 2024](https://sesug.org/SESUG2024/index.php) (and originally at [PharmaSUG 2022](https://www.pharmasug.org/us/index.html)).

## Setup and tools

To help you to get the most from this workshop, we recommend that you install at least some of the following tools.
