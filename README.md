# Using Git with your SAS projects

This project contains supporting materials for the Git &amp; SAS hands-on workshop presented at [PharmaSUG 2022](https://www.pharmasug.org/us/index.html).

## Setup and tools

To help you to get the most from this workshop, we recommend that you install at least some of the following tools. You probably won't have all of these tools; select the options that are most interesting to you. We'll demonstrate techniques for all of these and you'll be able to follow along and practice with those that you have.
